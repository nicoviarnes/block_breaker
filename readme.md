	Game Mechanics:
		- The game is a classic block-breaking game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and tries to break a grid of blocks at the top using a bouncing ball.
		- The player moves the paddle horizontally to bounce the ball back up towards the blocks, aiming to break as many blocks as possible.
		- The ball should bounce off the walls and the paddle, and if the player fails to bounce it back up and it hits the bottom of the screen, they lose a life.
		- The game ends when the player loses all their lives or clears all the blocks.

	Game Elements:
		- Paddle: Create a rectangular sprite as the player's paddle at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the paddle left and right to control the ball's direction.
		- Blocks: Design different types of blocks (e.g., colored squares) arranged in a grid at the top of the screen. Each block should have a durability value indicating how many hits it can withstand before breaking.
		- Ball: Create a circular sprite representing the ball that will bounce off the walls, paddle, and blocks. The ball's direction changes when it collides with objects.

	User Interface:
		- Start screen: Design a simple start screen with options to start a new game, access game settings, or view high scores.
		- Game screen: Display the paddle, blocks, and ball. Include the player's score, remaining lives, and level information.
		- End screen: Show the player's final score and provide options to play again or return to the start screen.

	Power-Ups:
		- Add power-ups that randomly spawn when certain blocks are broken. For example, a power-up could make the paddle larger, increase the ball's speed, or grant the player an extra life.
		- When the player collects a power-up by hitting it with the paddle, the effect should be activated immediately and enhance their gameplay temporarily.

	Sound Effects and Visual Feedback:
		- Include sound effects for the ball bouncing off the walls, paddle, and blocks.
		- Provide visual feedback when blocks are hit and broken, such as an animation or particles to indicate destruction.
		- Add visual effects and sound cues for collecting power-ups.
